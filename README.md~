# Domain Generalization with Fruit #

## My lord, I love fruit so much! ## 

Imagine you trained a RESNET-18 classifier on a set of pristine fruit images... I'm talking clear, cropped images of fresh, flavorful fruit.

Now imagine you deployed this model to classify fruit in real-life settings -- say a farm or a market. ...It's probably not going to do very well, is it?

We define this flaw as a lack of generalizability across a context-introduction shift.

In this experiment, we explore methods of improving the generalizability of models trained on out-of-context images. Namely, we measure the effect of augmenting training data with image transformations including random translations and random noise perturbations.
